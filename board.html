          Hello! My name is Emma and I am a sophomore at Barnard College. This will be my first semester as a CUBE repetiteur and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity. I started ballet when I was 4-years-old at Logrea Dance Academy in Westchester, New York and have been dancing ever since. At age 10, I moved to Beijing, China where I danced with Chinese and Japanese teachers, and eventually attended a studio that followed syllabuses from Royal Academy of Dance and Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. In the past, I have choreographed for my school’s dance team and volunteered in teaching young students ballet.
		  I am very excited to bring those skills to CUBE’s production of Don Quixote this semester!</p>
